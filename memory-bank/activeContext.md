# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Project kickoff: establish comprehensive documentation in the memory bank.
- Clarify functional requirements and data model details with the user before implementation.

## Recent Actions
- Created initial memory bank with core context files summarizing Itemly goals, product needs, architecture, and tech stack.

## Next Steps
- Confirm data model specifics (ownership, categories, locations) and CRUD requirements.
- Decide on photo storage approach and limits.
- Plan authentication implementation (password storage, session duration).
- Outline UI structure (pages, navigation, filtering).

## Open Questions
- Should categories be predefined, user-managed, or free-form text?
- How should houses/locations be modeled (hierarchy of house â†’ room, etc.)?
- Any constraints on file size/type for item photos?
- What level of filtering/search is required on the item list?
- Are activity logs or history tracking needed?
