- Ability to keep photos and details up to date, preventing misplacement.

## User Experience Goals
- Friendly, modern UI with Tailwind styling that feels approachable to all ages.
- Straightforward login with the known family password.
- Efficient item workflows: add/edit/delete without confusion.
- Clear visibility into houses and item ownership at a glance.
- Provide feedback (notifications/toasts) when actions succeed or fail.
