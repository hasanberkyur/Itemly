# Progress Log

## Status Summary
- Documentation initialized; memory bank now contains project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, active context, and progress notes.
- Application implementation has not started yet.
- Requirements clarified for categories, locations, file uploads, filtering, and design references.

## What Works
- Memory bank infrastructure established to support future development cycles.

## Outstanding Work
- Implement Flask app structure (package scaffolding, blueprints, config).
- Wire Tailwind build pipeline and import design samples into Jinja templates.
- Build database schema and migrations for members, locations, categories, items.
- Implement authentication, item CRUD flows, and upload handling/validation.
- Establish testing approach and deployment plan.

## Risks & Watch Items
- Need to ensure shared password is stored securely despite single-login simplicity.
- Must align templates with provided design samples (`designSamples/` directory) for consistent UX.
- Define clear UX for adding new family members and houses to avoid cluttered admin flows.
- Ensure Tailwind build toolchain works offline (no CDN reliance) due to restricted network.

## Phase Plan
- **Phase 0 – Foundations**
  - Finalize requirements and design references with stakeholders.
  - Confirm initial data model (members, locations, items, categories).
  - Set up Tailwind build pipeline and Flask project skeleton.
- **Phase 1 – Core Functionality**
  - Implement authentication with single shared password.
  - Build item CRUD flows with owner/location/category selection and custom category input.
  - Add photo upload handling (validation, storage under `static/uploads/`, thumbnail display).
- **Phase 2 – Catalog Experience**
  - Implement item list with filters (owner, location, category), text search, and sort by last updated.
  - Integrate design samples into responsive templates styled with Tailwind.
  - Display item metadata (owner, location, last updated) clearly in UI.
- **Phase 3 – Polish & QA**
  - Add input validation, error handling, and user feedback messages.
  - Write tests for authentication, CRUD operations, filtering, and uploads.
  - Prepare documentation for setup, seeding data, and future deployment steps.
